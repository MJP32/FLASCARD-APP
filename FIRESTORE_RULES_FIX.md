# Fixing "Failed to Load Cards" Error - Firestore Security Rules

## Most Common Cause: Firestore Security Rules

The "failed to load cards" error is typically caused by Firestore security rules that are blocking read access. Here's how to fix it:

### Step 1: Check the Error Details

1. Open your browser's Developer Console (F12)
2. Look for the specific error message - it will likely show "permission-denied"
3. Click the "Debug Firestore" button that appears with the error message

### Step 2: Update Firestore Security Rules

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `flashcard-app-3f2a3`
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** â†’ **Rules**
4. Replace the existing rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow users to read/write their own flashcards
    match /flashcards/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Allow users to read/write their own settings
    match /userSettings/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click **Publish**
